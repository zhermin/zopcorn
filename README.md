## Details
A simple react webapp with API integration. Very barebones and hope to continue building upon this project in the future. The only functionality right now is to display the list of movies that match the searched term. 

However, I would like to expand and add information such as the synopsis of the movies, ratings and comments if I have time. Additionally, the design can definitely benefit with a bit of work since it is rather plain currently. 

Overall, a good experience in thinking about web development outside of the manual and tedious way of writing every single line of html/css/js but instead, in terms of modules and components as well as programmatically generating the markup languages, indeed saving a lot of effort and time.
